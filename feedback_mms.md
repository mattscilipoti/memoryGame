# Project Feedback + Evaluation


## Project Workflow

> Did you complete the user stories, wireframes, task tracking, and/or ERDs, as specified above? Did you use source control as expected for the phase of the program youâ€™re in (detailed above)?

**Meets Expectations**. Your project is very clearly scoped and your user stories show that.  You've expressed yourself well in the readme.  In the future, it would be nice to see more evidence of your planning process, like the hand-drawn images you refer to and stories created for the steps you allude to in your "approach" discussion.

## Technical Requirements

> Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements? Given what the class has covered so far, did you build something that was reasonably complex?

**Meets Expectations**. Congratulations.  All the concepts covered during the first few week of WDI are represented.  You have tackled some complex problems.  I was surprised to checkout master and find next to nothing.  The expectation is that your latest code is in master branch and you merge various, trusted commits into gh-pages.  Work is done in feature branches.  Completed work is merged into master.  Master is merged in gh-pages at priodic intervals.

## Code Quality

> Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, modularity, and semantic naming? Did you comment your code as your instructors have in class?

**Meets Expectations**. Html is clearly structured. Code is somewhat organized.  You asked a good questions about consolidating and cleaning up your code.  Your code would benefit from extracting a few methods to organize and identify responsibilities.  The first step I took was setting proper indentation.  It made it much easier to reason about your code.  Why are timer.js and and empty jQuery.js file here?

## Problem Solving

> Are you able to defend why you implemented your solution in a certain way? Can you demonstrate that you thought through alternative implementations?

**Meets Expectations**. Excellent job on this project! I really like your "plan for next time".  Identify when something is difficult and look for a better answer (cut or change).  Unfortunately, I just got jQuery errors when I tried your deployed code.  I expect that more focus on cleanup and organization would help clarify (and solve) issues.
